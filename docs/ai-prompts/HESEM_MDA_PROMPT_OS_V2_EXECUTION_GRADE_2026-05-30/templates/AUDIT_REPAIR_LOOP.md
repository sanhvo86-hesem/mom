# Audit, Adversarial Review, Simulation, Repair Loop Template


# Common execution constitution for every prompt

You are operating inside `sanhvo86-hesem/mom`, the HESEM ERP + MOM + MES + eQMS repository. Execute exactly the current prompt, then run audit, adversarial review, operational simulation, repair, verification, and handoff before moving to the next prompt.

## Non-negotiable behavior

1. Do not ask the user follow-up questions.
2. Do not guess. If a fact is not verified from repository evidence, write `NOT_EVIDENCED`, log it in the controlled gap ledger, and choose the safest non-mutating plan.
3. Do not declare production readiness. Use `development`, `prototype`, `current portal safety`, `pre-production readiness`, or `release-readiness planning` only.
4. Do not bypass repository governance. Read `.ai/CONVENTIONS.md`, `.ai/repo-map.json`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.ai/AI-WORKFLOW.md` before touching any file.
5. Do not start broad rewrites, framework replacement, direct machine-control behavior, uncontrolled mutation, hidden authority in workspaces, e-sign without signature meaning, or AI-driven regulated decisions.
6. Planning prompts must not change runtime code unless the prompt explicitly says `CODE_MUTATION_ALLOWED`.
7. Implementation prompts must create a `codex/...` branch before edits, inspect `git status`, migration numbering, changed files, and branch overlap, then commit every logical unit.
8. Every prompt must emit a decision token. Only `*_PASS_READY_FOR_NEXT` or `*_PASS_WITH_CONTROLLED_GAPS` unlocks the next prompt. `*_REPAIR_REQUIRED`, `*_BLOCKED`, or missing evidence keeps the current prompt active.
9. If the environment lacks a tool or executable, do not stop silently. Produce a blocker report, a self-contained repair prompt, and the exact verification command to rerun. Do not claim pass evidence for a command that did not complete.
10. Each prompt must produce machine-readable evidence and a human-readable report.

## Mandatory output files per prompt

Use this root unless the prompt overrides it:

```text
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/
```

For prompt `PXX`, create or update all of these files:

```text
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_MAIN.md
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_SOURCE_TRUTH_AUDIT.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_AUTHORITY_MATRIX.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_OPERATIONAL_SIMULATION_MATRIX.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_GAP_AND_REPAIR_LEDGER.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_VERIFICATION_LOG.md
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/PXX_<slug>_HANDOFF_PACKET.md
```

Append shared ledgers:

```text
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_RUN_MANIFEST.md
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_SEQUENCE_STATE.json
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_MASTER_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_CONTROLLED_GAP_LEDGER.csv
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_DECISION_LOG.md
_reports/agent-audits/mda-prompt-os-v2-2026-05-30/MDA_V2_REPAIR_PROMPT_QUEUE.md
```

## Required report sections

Each `MAIN.md` must contain these sections in this exact order:

1. `Domain affected`
2. `Prompt objective`
3. `Previous gate check`
4. `Repository orientation evidence`
5. `Source-truth audit`
6. `Current-state findings`
7. `Target authority design or implementation plan`
8. `Commands/APIs/events/workflows involved`
9. `Tables/stores/contracts/routes involved`
10. `Operational gates and stop rules`
11. `Operational simulation summary`
12. `Adversarial review summary`
13. `Repair pass applied`
14. `Verification evidence`
15. `Remaining controlled gaps`
16. `Decision token`

## Universal audit loop

Before emitting a pass token, perform this loop:

```text
A. Self-audit: check every claim has repo/source evidence or NOT_EVIDENCED.
B. Red-team critique: attack authority, lifecycle, mutation, data quality, idempotency, security, evidence, e-sign, traceability, performance, rollback, and UI projection safety.
C. Operational simulation: run positive, negative, race, replay/idempotency, offline/degraded, security, regulatory, rollback, and cross-module scenarios.
D. Repair: fix the report/code/design/tests for every P0/P1 issue found.
E. Re-audit: repeat A-D until no P0/P1 remains or a tool/environment blocker is documented.
F. Token: emit the strict decision token.
```

## Severity model

```text
P0 = data loss, unsafe mutation, security/regulatory bypass, hidden authority, destructive migration, direct machine-control behavior, release without rollback, e-sign/audit falsification.
P1 = wrong authority, broken gate, missing command contract, missing test for governed mutation, broken idempotency, major workflow/status inconsistency.
P2 = implementation gap controlled by backlog, report artifact gap, non-blocking automation debt, incomplete dashboard/runbook.
P3 = editorial, naming, formatting, minor UX clarity.
```

## Required simulation columns

Every operational simulation matrix must include:

```text
scenario_id, scenario_type, domain, trigger, preconditions, command_or_api, tables_or_stores, expected_result, forbidden_result, gate_or_stop_rule, evidence_required, test_to_add_or_run, repair_if_failed, final_status
```

## Required source-truth audit columns

```text
claim_id, claim, source_tag, exact_source_path_or_url, verification_method, confidence, risk_if_wrong, status
```

## Required handoff packet sections

```text
1. What was completed
2. What must not be re-decided
3. Exact files changed or created
4. Exact commands run
5. Exact tests passed/failed/blocked
6. Remaining controlled gaps
7. Next prompt unlock token
8. Self-contained recovery prompt if next AI loses context
```


## Self-audit questions

1. Which claims were verified by exact source path?
2. Which claims are `NOT_EVIDENCED`?
3. Which records/tables/routes/contracts could become hidden authority?
4. Which mutation path could bypass command API, workflow, audit, evidence, e-signature, or idempotency?
5. Which downstream gate could read stale or wrong data?
6. Which JSON/PG drift could corrupt release readiness?
7. Which UI workspace could mutate without authoritative record re-anchor?
8. Which AI/copilot behavior could cross from advisory to authority?
9. Which rollback/restore path is missing?
10. Which simulation proves the failure is blocked?

## Red-team roles

Run each role and record findings:

- Plant manager
- Production planner
- CNC programmer
- Machine operator
- Quality engineer
- Supplier quality engineer
- Buyer/procurement
- Warehouse/material handler
- Maintenance/calibration owner
- HR/training owner
- Finance/controller
- Security/OT architect
- Regulatory/eQMS auditor
- Customer auditor
- Data steward/MDM owner
- SRE/release engineer
- AI governance reviewer

## Repair rule

For every P0/P1 finding, either fix the report/code/test in the same prompt or keep the prompt locked with `REPAIR_REQUIRED` / `BLOCKED_*`. Do not move to the next prompt.
